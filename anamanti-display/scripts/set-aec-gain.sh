# Set the Echo Show 8 (gen-1, `crown`) AEC shim's post-cancellation makeup gain,
# `persist.vendor.amznaec.gain_db`, over adb.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT AN IN-APP SETTING
# ----------------------------------------------
# `gain_db` is a **vendor system property** read by the `libamznaec_shim.so` AEC shim
# that is `LD_PRELOAD`ed into `android.hardware.audio.service` (see plans/TODO.md §2 and
# plans/architecture.md §4). Setting a `persist.vendor.*` prop goes through init's
# property service and is gated by SELinux — the sandboxed Flutter app
# (`com.anamanti.anamanti_display`, `untrusted_app` domain) CANNOT set it, and there is
# no `su`/Magisk on the device for it to borrow. So shim gain is a **device-provisioning
# step**, done here with adb root. (The in-app "Capture gain (dB)" setting is the
# app-side, root-free analogue that boosts the signal later in the Rust audio pipeline;
# this script tunes the shim's own makeup gain, applied inside the HAL after cancellation.)
#
# The shim reads `gain_db` when the audio HAL process starts, so a change only takes
# effect after the HAL restarts. This script sets the (persistent) prop and then
# restarts the audio HAL; if that can't be resolved it tells you to reboot.
#
# Usage:
#   anamanti-display/scripts/set-aec-gain.sh [GAIN_DB] [ADB_SERIAL]
#
#   GAIN_DB     integer dB, default 34 (the value tuned for the production unit; the
#               shim's own default is 20). Raise toward ~34 if the streamed mic level is
#               too low (missed speech onset); dial to ~30 if close/loud speech clips.
#   ADB_SERIAL  optional; target a specific device when several are attached.
